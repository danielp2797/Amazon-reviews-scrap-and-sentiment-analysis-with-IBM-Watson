4. Store credentials as .json file in

```
config/creentials/credentials.json
```

with the following structure:
```
{
  "APIkey": "API key here",
  "URL": "URL here"
}
```

## Start üöÄ

_Just clone the repository_

```
git clone https://github.com/danielp2797/Amazon-reviews-scrap-and-sentiment-analysis-with-IBM-Watson
```
then install src package from setup.py file in the project root directory
```
pip install -e .
```
and finally install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage üì¶
_Select an Amazon's product review page as for example:_
```
https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Pantalla-Retina-pulgadas-espacial-renovado/product-reviews/B07F93611L/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
```
and run the main.py as follows:
```
python3 main.py <url>
```
If it works, you will see this verbose in your console:

![Alt text](figures/readme/proof_of_concept.png?raw=true "Title")

The scraped results are stored in
```
data/reviews/raw
```
as .csv file with the system timestamp as the file name. An example of the .csv structure is:

|title|content                      |date  |variant                                      |images|verified|author    |rating            |product                                                                                                             |url|

The company even put a screen protector on it which I absolutely love because I didn‚Äôt have the buy one, so I really love that I bought it used so of course it‚Äôs just a little things that I worry about because it is secondhand but overall it‚Äôs absolutely lovely and I love it.|Calificado en Estados Unidos üá∫üá∏ el 24 de octubre de 2022|Tama√±o: Paquete de 5 Wireless communication technology: Wi-Fi Color: Gris (Space Grey)|      |Yes     |Maya gayle|5.0 de 5 estrellas|Apple iPad de 9.7 pulgadas (reacondicionado) (modelo 2018) con Wi-Fi solamente. 32 GB, iPad MR7F2LL/A, gris espacial|   |

Once we have the data, is time to move on notebooks. Take a look at
```

```
There is a simple sentiment analysis and keywords extraction. In the sample case led to the following word cloud plot:

with interesting insights, such as:
1. We should care about battery life
2. Look the condition of the charger
3. It seems that "great" and "condition" are commonly contained in reviews, so people, generally, is satisfied with the product.

## I hope it will help you üéÅ
